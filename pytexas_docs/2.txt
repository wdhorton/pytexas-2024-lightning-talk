{"talk_title": "Voice Computing with Python in Jupyter Notebooks", "talk_description": "Jupyter Notebook is a popular platform for writing literate programming documents that contain computer code and its output interleaved with prose that describes the code and the output. Recently, it has become possible to use one's voice to interact with Jupyter notebooks. This capability opens access to those with impaired use of their hands. Voice computing also increases the productivity of workers who are tired of typing and increases the productivity of those workers who speak faster than they can type. I split voice computing into three activities: speech-to-text, speech-to-command, and speech-to-code. Several automated speech recognition software packages operate in Jupyter notebooks and support the three activities to a certain degree. I will provide examples of all three activities as they pertain to applications of Python to our research on the molecular structures of proteins and nucleic acids important in medicine. I have developed and shared several software tools at MooersLab on GitHub and Codeberg that facilitate using existing voice computing software in Jupyter.", "speaker": "Blaine Mooers", "speaker_bio": "Blaine Mooers is an associate professor of biochemistry and physiology at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences. He has been using Python to develop tools to ease the use of structural biology software by his students and other scientists. He has spoken at Jupyter Con and participated in several SciPy Conferences."}
