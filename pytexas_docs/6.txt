{"talk_title": "Plugging in with pkgutil, importlib, inspect, and a little spit", "talk_description": "Sometimes, you want to build a framework where expansion can come via installed python packages and modules. There are third party libraries to handle that, but maybe you don't want something that heavy weight, don't want to handle the burden of security and quality testing releases, or just want to write your own so you know how it works. I'll walk you through how to create a pluggable framework where plugins can be delivered as Python packages. I'll show you some useful standard library packages that you need, some pitfalls along the way, and how to get a working prototype in no time!", "speaker": "Josh Schneider", "speaker_bio": "Father of two boys.
